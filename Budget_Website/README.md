# Budget Website — Starter

This is a minimal React + Redux + TypeScript starter scaffolded with Vite.

Getting started (Windows `cmd.exe`):

```
cd "c:\Users\rodne\Helix outriders\Budget_Website"
npm install
npm run dev
```

- `npm run dev` starts the Vite dev server (open URL shown in terminal).
- `npm run build` creates a production build in `dist/`.
- `npm run preview` previews the production build.

Notes:
- This project uses `@reduxjs/toolkit` and `react-redux` with a small `counter` slice as an example.
- Edit `src` to start building your budget app: `store`, features, components, and routes.
